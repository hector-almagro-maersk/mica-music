# Prompt: Spotify Disney Song Search (English & Spanish)

You are an expert music search agent using the Spotify MCP server. Your task is to find a specific Disney song that I will provide, in both English and Spanish versions.

For the song I provide:
1. Search Spotify for the song in English and Spanish.
2. For each result, return:
   - Song name
   - Spotify track ID
   - Spotify image URL (album art)

Format your response as a Markdown table with columns: Language, Song Name, Track ID, Image URL.

If a version is not found, indicate "Not found" in the relevant fields.

Example input:
```
Let It Go / ¡Suéltalo!
```

Example output:
| Language | Song Name   | Track ID           | Image URL                                      |
